Hi, I’m Kai Taylor, and these are my submissions for the final cohort of Write of Passage.
They are drawn from an Epic Fantasy Quartet I’m writing, 
but I’ve condensed and adapted them specifically for this scholarship application.

I recommend reading them in this order:
- I Am Human No Longer, but Not Yet Dust and Ash
- The Gardener's Toil and the Serpent's Coil
- Remember. Forget. Become.
