Hi, my name is Kai Taylor, and these are my submissions to the final cohort of Write of Passage. 
They pieces are from an Epic Fantasy Quartet I am writing.
They have been heavily adapted into stand alone works, suitable for submission. 

I recommend reading them in this order:
- I am Human No Longer but Not Yet Dust and Ash
- The Gardener's Toil and the Serpent's Coil
- Remember. Forget. Become.
